              At Popwork, we believe there is a better way to manage people.
            </p>
            <p>
              Management is the very foundation of every organisation, impacting
              the way we perform and find purpose at work.
            </p>
            <p>
              Yet for too long, managers have been left alone and lack support
              to manage their teams.
